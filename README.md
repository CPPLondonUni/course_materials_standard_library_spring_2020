# C++ London Uni — Getting to Know the Standard Library

This course is an introduction into C++ standard library containers and algorithms.
We talk about the common principles and patterns for the standard library components and
go into details for most widely used containers and algorithms.

The course uses small algorithmic problems (for example, checking if a word is a palindrome)
to illustrate the uses of containers and algorithms and to discuss the best practices and
common mistakes.

Prerequisites: basic knowledge of C++ (types, classes, loops, constructors) or familiarity
with any other programming language with interest in C++.
